Goal of 403 - Develop an algorithm in Python that when a set of EEG data was inputted the mental state of the user was determined. This 
  algorithm would classify the user as Mentally awake, tired to the point of almost falling asleep, and essentially sleeping. Data for 
  this semester is to be taken using a device called a muse. Multiple sessions of scenarios of a user being awake/sleepy were taken to
  get a basis for each classification.

What was accomplished in 403:
  - A supervised learning algorithm was chosen to be the best fit for the problem of determining mental state due to its ability
    to classify inputs into discrete states.
  - k-NearestNeighbors was the first algorithm written to solve this problem. The algorithm itself worked fine and had very accurate 
    results for the dataset we had in 403 but as that dataset increased it was determined that the algorithm was too slow for our 
    purposes.
  - A Support Vector Machine using a radial basis was then implemented to decrease the runtime. This is the algorithm currently 
    being used.
  - Algorithms were validated using a dataset of around 40,000 points. 70% of the data was used as the training set and 30% was
    used as a test set.
    
Goal of 404 - Integrate the machine learning algorithm into the the app and begin collecting data using our system to build a dataset
  specific to our system.
  
What needs to be done in 404:
  - Edit the current algorithm from taking an entire dataset and validating it by splitting into learning/test set to learning from the
    entire dataset saved in the cloud and waiting for inputs from the system so it can classify as they come in.
  - Make any changes to the program so that the python code can easily interface with the app.
  - Collect data
  - Make edits to the algorithm as our dataset increases to increase the accuracy of the classification.
